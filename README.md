# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical customer data.

The complete workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — is implemented in a **single structured Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies customers into:
- **Churn = Yes**
- **Churn = No**

This enables businesses to take **data-driven retention actions**.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-level information such as:
- Demographic details  
- Subscription and service usage  
- Contract and billing information  

**Target Variable**
- `Churn` → Binary classification label

All preprocessing steps (missing values, encoding, scaling) are clearly documented inside the notebook.

---

## 🔬 Methodology
The project follows a standard **machine learning pipeline**:

1. Data Loading and Inspection  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature Engineering  
5. Model Training  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Performance Analysis and Conclusions

## 🧠 Models Used
Depending on the notebook configuration, models may include:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- (Optional) Neural Network  

Model selection and justification are explained within the notebook.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC (where applicable)

These metrics ensure a balanced evaluation, especially for **class-imbalanced churn data**.

---

## 📌 Key Results
- The model successfully captures churn patterns in customer behavior.
- Important features influencing churn are identified.
- Results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning for churn prediction.

Detailed results, plots, and interpretations are available in the notebook.
